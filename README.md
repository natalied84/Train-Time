# Train-Time

### Introduction

This homeworks intent is to increase skills in using Firebase and Moment.js as well as continuing to build JS, JQuery, and all previous skills. The aim was to make a train scheduler that calculates the arrival times of trains. I added a clear button that uses the Firebase key generate for each train added to clear it for the DB and I used JQuery to remove it from the page.

### Technologies

Firebase, Moment.js, JQuery, Bootstrap 4

### Features

-The ability to add trains 

-The page will calculate the arrival time of the next train

-The ability to remove lines

#### Features I'd like to add

-logins

-automatic time updates

-better styling

-sound effects...?

-maybe an easter egg
